Others are numeric values\n(measures) for analysis. The keys are used to relate a fact table to one or more dimension tables, \noften in a star schema; in which the fact table is directly related to each dimension table (forming a \nmulti-pointed “star” with the fact table at the center).\n\n*/\nselect column_name, data_type from information_schema.columns where table_name = 'FactInternetSales' order by ordinal_position\n",
